Official repository of the paper "_Enhancing protein interaction design through Monte Carlo Simulation with learning-based interaction score, AlphaFold, and KAN-based Positive-Unlabeled learning_". We are in the process of checking in the relevant files.

### TODO
- Remove irrelevant files from the 'codebase' folder.
- Remove irrelevant root_path expression from all the files.
- remove print statement from all the files. Use regular expression print\( in Fine and Replace. See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50574731/vscode-delete-all-comments-in-a-file
- Remove code comments from all the files. Use regular expression # .* in Fine and Replace. See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50574731/vscode-delete-all-comments-in-a-file


### TO BE PUT IN THE FINAL VERSION OF THE REPO
- We utilized a conda environment with Python 3.11.4 for code execution. The environment was created using the py3114_torch_gpu_param.yml file.
- We leveraged [LocalColabFold](https://github.com/YoshitakaMo/localcolabfold?tab=readme-ov-file) for running AlphaFold2. Please refer to their website for guidance on executing AlphaFold2.
- We used [GROMACS](https://www.gromacs.org/) for Molecular Dynamics simulations. Please visit their website for instructions on running Molecular Dynamics simulations.
- We explored multiple approaches while implementing our ideas, which resulted in a codebase that initially included numerous options, only a few of which were ultimately selected. We made an effort to clean up the codebase as thoroughly as possible before uploading. If you encounter any issues, please to let us know.
